# The logic of script.js

The findNoise function in your code generates Perlin noise, which is a type of gradient noise often used in procedural content generation. It is especially useful for applications that need to simulate natural phenomena, due to its characteristic appearance and analytical properties cssscript.com.

In your code, the findNoise function is used to create a "wavy" effect in a canvas animation. It does this by generating a noise value for each point (px, py) on a line, and then using this value to adjust the y-coordinate of the point. This has the effect of making the line "wavy", because the noise value varies smoothly as px and py change, causing the y-coordinate to oscillate up and down in a smooth wave-like pattern. The time variable is added to the py coordinate to create an animation effect, as the noise values will change over time, causing the waves to move.

Here's a breakdown of what the script does:

1. It first sets up a canvas and gets its context. The canvas dimensions are set to match the window dimensions.
2. The drawContent function is then called to start the animation. This function does the following:
* Clears the entire canvas.
* Iterates over a number of lines (lineNum). For each line, it does the following:
 ** Begins a new path for the line.
 ** Sets the line width and color.
 ** Iterates over a number of segments (segNum) in the line. For each segment, it does the following:
  *** Calculates the x-coordinate of the segment (x).
  *** Calls findNoise with px and py to get a noise value. This value is used to calculate the y-coordinate of the segment (y).
  *** If it's the first segment, it moves the path to (x, y). Otherwise, it adds a line to (x, y).

 ** After iterating over all segments, it strokes the path to draw the line on the canvas.

3. Finally, it calls requestAnimationFrame(drawContent) to schedule the next frame of the animation. This creates a loop that keeps the animation running cssscript.com.

The result is an animation of multiple wavy lines moving down the canvas. The findNoise function is key to this effect, as it generates the smoothly varying noise values that make the lines wavy and animate them over time.
